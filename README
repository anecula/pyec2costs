Currently Amazon's EC2 API does not have any end points for getting current prices for reserved or ondemand instances.  
I found the JSON files that Amazon uses to display http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/ 
but unfortunately the names for regions, instance types and sizes were all different 
values then what Amazon uses in its API.  This module aims to solve the issue of getting 
EC2 pricing data and having it in a format compatible with results from it's API.
